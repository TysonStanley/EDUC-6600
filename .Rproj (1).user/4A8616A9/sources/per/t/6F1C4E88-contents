# Chapter 1. DATA PREPARATION

```{r, include=FALSE}
# set global chunk options...  
#  this changes the defaults so you don't have to repeat yourself
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment     = NA,
                      echo        = TRUE, 
                      warning     = FALSE, 
                      message     = FALSE,
                      fig.align   = "center", # center all figures
                      fig.width   = 4,        # set default figure width to 4 inches
                      fig.height  = 3)        # set default figure height to 3 inches

```

## Load Packages

* Make sure the packages are **installed** *(Package tab)*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)    # Loads several very helpful 'tidy' packages
library(readxl)       # Read in Excel datasets
library(furniture)    # Nice tables
library(psych)        # Lots of nice tid-bits
```

## Import Data, Define Factors, and Compute New Variables

* Make sure the **dataset** is saved in the same *folder* as this file
* Make sure the that *folder* is the **working directory**

> NOTE: I added the second line to convert all the variables names to lower case.  I still kept the `F` as a capital letter at the end of the five factor variables.

# Chapter 2. DISTRIBUTION and UNIVARIATE PLOTS

## 2C-1. Frequency Distribution and Bar Chart

Request a frequency distribution using the `furniture::tableF(continuous_var)` function  

```{r}
# Frequency distrubution: majorF


```

Create a bar chart using `geom_bar()` for the Undergraduate Major (`majorF`) variable for Ihno's students.

> Make sure to add the variable of interest into the asthetics: `ggplot(aes(continuous_var))` before adding the `geom_bar()` layer.

```{r}
# Bar Plot: majorF


```

\clearpage

## 2C-2. Bar Charts

Repeat Exercise 1 for the variables `prevmath` and `phobia`. 

> IN THE WRITEUP: Would it make sense to request a histogram instead of a bar chart for phobia ? Discuss.

```{r}
# Bar Plot: prevmath


```

```{r}
# Bar Plot: phobia


```

\clearpage

## 2C-3. Frequency Distribution and Histogram

Request a frequency distribution and a histogram for the variable `statquiz`.  Use the option in the function `geom_histogram(bins = #)` to change the number of bins or `geom_histogram(binwidth = #)` to change the bin width to give a better figure.

**ANSWER:** Describe the shape of this distribution.

```{r}
# Frequency distrubution: statquiz


```


```{r}
# Histogram: statquiz, with a different number/width of bins


```

\clearpage

## 2C-4. Frequency Distribution and Histogram

Request a frequency distribution and a histogram for the variables baseline anxiety (`anx_base`) and baseline heart rate (`hr_base`). 

**ANSWER:** Comment on R's choice of class intervals for each histogram.

```{r}
# Frequency distrubution: anx_base


```

```{r}
# Histogram: anx_base


```

\clearpage

```{r}
# Frequency distrubution: hr_base


```


```{r}
# Histogram: hr_base


```

\clearpage

## 2C-6.  Histograms -by- a Factor

Request Histograms for the variables `anx_base` and `hr_base` divided by `genderF` using an additional `facet_grid(group_var ~ .)` layer to create two plots.

```{r}
# Histogram: anx_base, by genderF


```


```{r}
# Histogram: hr_base, by genderF


```

\clearpage

## 2C-9. Deciles and Quartiles

Using the `quantile(probs = c(#, #, ..., #))` function, request the deciles and quartiles for the `phobia` variable.  

> Make sure to add a `dplyr::pull(varname)` step to pull out only the one variable you are interested in.

```{r}
# Deciles: phobia


```

```{r}
# Quartiles: phobia


```



## 2C-10. Various Percentiles

Request the following percentiles for the variables `hr_base` and `hr_pre`: 15, 30, 42.5, 81, and 96.

# Chapter 3. SUMMARY DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS


## 3C-1/3. Descriptive Statistics -full-

Use the `psych::describe()` function to find the  the ~~mode~~, **median**, and **mean**, as well as the **range**, ~~semi-interquartile range~~, *unbiased* **variance**, and *unbiased* **standard deviation** for each of the *quantitative variables* in Ihno's data set.  

> Make sure to use a `dplyr::select(var1, var2, ..., var12)` step to select only the variables of interest.

```{r}
# Descriptive Stats: all quant vars


```



\clearpage

## 3C-4 Boxplots

### (a) Boxplot 

Create a plot for the `statquiz` variable using a `geom_boxplot()` layer. 

> Make sure to specify the astheticis in `ggplot(aes(...))`.  Since you want to plot the entire sample together, set `x = "Full Sample"` and `y = continuous_var`

```{r}
# Boxplot: statquiz


```


\clearpage

### (b) Boxplots -by- a Factor

Create a plot for the `statquiz` variable by `majorF`.

> Make sure to set `x = grouping_var` and `y = continuous_var` in the asthetics.

```{r}
# Boxplot: statquiz, by majorF


```


\clearpage

### (c) Boxplot -for- a Subset

Use a `dplyr::filter()` step filter the subjects in the dataset to create a **Boxplot** for the `statquiz` variable for just the `female Biology` majors.

> Make sure to use `==` instead of `=` to test for equality within the filter step. It will be helpful to set the asethics such that `x = one_grouping_var` and `fill = another_grouping_var`, while letting `y = continuous_var`.

```{r}
# Boxplot: statquiz, for a subset

 
```


\clearpage

### (d) Boxplots -by- a Factor and -for- a Subset

Use `dplyr::filter()` to create a SIDE-by-SIDE Boxplots for the `statquiz` variable that compares  the `female Psychology` majors to the `female Biology` majors.

> A helpful symbol-set is `%in%` which test if the thing before it is included in the concatinated list of elements that comes after it.

```{r}
# Boxplot: statquiz, by a factor, for a subset

 
```


\clearpage

## 3C-5. Boxplots -for- Repeated Measures

Create Boxplots for both baseline and prequiz **anxiety**, so that they appear side-by-side on the same graph.

> Some data manipulations is needed to "stack" the two variables (baseline and pre-test) into a single variable.  This is done with with the `tidyr::gather(key = new_key_var, value = new_value_var, old_var_1, old_var_2, ...)` function.
 
```{r}
# Boxplot: anxiety, compare two repeated measures


```
 

\clearpage

## 3C-6. Descriptive Statistics -by- a Factor
 
Use `furniture::table1()` to find the *mean* and *standard deviation* for each of the *quantitative variables* separately for the `male` and `female` econ majors.

> Make sure to use the `splitby = ~ grouping_var` option. 

```{r}
# Descriptive Stats: all quant vars, by genderF


```

\clearpage

# Chapter 4. STANDARDIZED SCORES

## 4C-1. Calculate z-Scores

Use the `dplyr::mutate(new_zscore_var = scale(old_orig_var))` function to create two new variables consisting of the *z scores* for the **anxiety** and **heart rate** measures at **baseline** in Ihno's data set. 

Request *means* and *SD's* of the *z-score* variables to demonstrate that the means and SD s are `0` and `1`, respectively, in each case.

```{r}
# Descriptive Stats: baseline anx & hr, original and z-scores


```


# Chapter 5. Intro to Hypothesis Testing: 1 Sample `z`-Test

## FIX!!! 5C-3. 1 Sample `z`-Test compared to historic controls for `mathquiz` and `statquiz`

**TEXTBOOK QUESTION:** *(A) In the past 10 years, previous stats classes who took the same math quiz that Inho's students took **averaged 28** with a **standard deviation of 8.5**. What is the two-tailed p value for Inho's students with respect to that past population? (Don't forget that the N for mathquiz is not 100.)  Would you say that Inho's class performed significantly better than previous classes? Explain. (B) Redo part a assuming that the same previous classes had also taken the same statquiz and **averaged 6.1** with a **standard deviation of 2.5**.*

**DIRECTIONS:** Find the mean (`M`) and sample size (`n`) for `mathquiz` and `statquiz` and then work the rest of the statistical test by hand in the printed homework packet.  

> **NOTE:** You may use the `furniture::table1()` funciton gives the mean, but it only gives the total `n` for all variables.  Since some students were missing the math quiz, but not the stat quiz the sample sizes are different.  So use the `psych::describe()` function to get the means and the sample size for each variable.

```{r}
# Find the mean and n for: mathquiz, statquiz

```

**ANSWER:** 






\clearpage

## 5C-4. Test for Normaity for `mathquiz` and `statquiz`

**TEXTBOOK QUESTION:** *Test both the math quiz and stat quiz variables for their resemblance to normal distributions. Based on skewness, kurtosis, and the Shapiro-Wilk statistic, which variable has a sample distribution that is not very consistent with the assumption of normality in the population?*

### Skewness and Kurtosis

**DIRECTIONS:** Find the skewness and kurtosis for `mathquiz` and `statquiz` 

> **NOTE:** Yes, you just did this above using the `psych::describe()` function... so you may skip it here if you want.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Find the skewness and kurtosis for: mathquiz, statquiz

```


### Shapiro-Wilk's Test

**DIRECTIONS:**  Use the `shapiro.test()` function to test for normality in a small'ish sample.

> **NOTE:** You must use a `dplyr::pull()` step to pull out one variable from the dataset before you can use the `shapiro.test()` function.

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk's Normality Test for: mathquiz

```

```{r}
# Shapiro-Wilk's Normality Test for: statquiz

```

\clearpage

### Create Histograms

**DIRECTIONS:**  Use `geom_histogram()` after setting the `ggplot(aes())`.  Make sure to try different `bins = #` or `binwidth = #` to get a 'good looking' plot.

> **NOTE:** For histograms, you do need to specify the variable name as `x`in the `aes(x = variable)` option.  

```{r}
# Histogram for: mathquiz

```

```{r}
# Histogram for: statquiz

```

\clearpage

### Create QQ Plots

**DIRECTIONS:**  Use `geom_qq()` after setting the `ggplot(aes())`.  

> **NOTE:** For qq plots, you do need to specify the variable name as `sample`in the `aes(sample = variable)` option.  

```{r}
# Histogram for: mathquiz

```

```{r}
# Histogram for: statquiz

```

# Chapter 6. Confidence Interval Estimation: The `t` Distribution

## 6C-1. 1-sample `t`-tests for `anx_base`, `anx_pre`, and `anx_post`


**TEXTBOOK QUESTION:** *Perform one-sample t tests to determine whether the baseline, pre-, or postquiz anxiety scores of Inho's students differ significantly ( $\alpha = .05$, two-tailed) from the mean ($\mu = 18$) found by a very large study of college students across the country. Find the 95% Cconfidence interval for the population mean for each of the **three** anxiety measures.*


**DIRECTIONS:**  Use the `t.test(mu = #)` function to perform a 1 sample `t`-test.  Make sure to sepify the Null hypothesis value for $\mu$.

> **NOTE:** You must use a `dplyr::pull()` step to pull out one variable from the dataset before you can use the `t.test()` function.

```{r}
# 1-sample t-test for: anx_base

```

```{r}
# 1-sample t-test for: anx_base

```

```{r}
# 1-sample t-test for: anx_base

```






\clearpage

## 6C-2. 1-sample `t`-tests for `hr_base` among MEN

**TEXTBOOK QUESTION:** *Perform a one-sample t test to determine whether the average baseline heart rate of Inho's **male** students differs significantly from the **mean** heart rate ($\mu = 70$) for college-aged men at the **.01 level**, two-tailed. Find the **99%** confidence intervals for the population mean represented by Inho's **male** students.*

**DIRECTIONS:** Similar to the last problem, use the `t.test(mu = #)` function to perform a 1 sample `t`-test.  This time, make sure the subset out the males only with a `dplyr::filter()` step prior to the `dplyr::pull()` step.

> **note:** To change from the default 95% confidence intervals, make sure to specify `conf.level = 0.99` inside the `t.test()` function.

```{r}
# 1-sample t-test for MALES: hr_base

```





\clearpage 

## 6C-3. 1-sample `t`-tests for `hr_post` among FEMALE

**TEXTBOOK QUESTION:** *Perform a one-sample t test to determine whether the average postquiz heart rate of Inho's **female** students differs significantly ($\alpha = .05$, two-tailed) from the **mean** resting heart rate ($\mu = 72$) for college-aged women. Find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean represented by Inho's **female** students.*

**DIRECTIONS:** This time, subset out WOMEN and choose the post-quiz heart rate.  Also, use a different population null value.

```{r}
# 1-sample t-test for MALES: hr_base

```
